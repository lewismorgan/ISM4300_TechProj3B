Randomly populates an array with a size of 25 elements with numbers from 0-1337. Each element value is then printed into the console. 
There is no restriction in duplicates within the array from the random generator.

## Assignment

1. Choose either type of array (Manually populated or Auto populated) seen in the example
2. The program doesn't ask the user anything, it will just run and execute code. No user input.
3. Have the program execute an array that is of size 25 elements.
4. Then, have the code simply display in the Console the following 25 times (Here is a sample of the output):

Element value = 1

Element value = 2

Element value = 3

.......... and so on .....

Element value = 25
